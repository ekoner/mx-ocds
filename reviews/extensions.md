# Extensions

Extensions are not an official part of the standard, and will only be considered to become so as part of the upgrade process to 1.1, which will take place over Q2/Q3 this year.

### Process for developing official extensions of OCDS is to

  - Post, or add to, an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues) describing the extension required
  - Engage in the discussion there on a proposed extension - and share examples of data using a proposed extension

## Multi-year Contract

[Issue #293](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/293)

  - propose extension
  - sample of data
  - justification
  - create the [JSON Schema Patch and Readme file](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/extensions/developing/) required

## Compare Federal vs CDMX
